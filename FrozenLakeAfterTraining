After training the agent using epsilon-greedy algorithm,the agent tends to perform well on the environments with smaller number of states.
Poor performance continues in environments with large number of states.
Tried using an alternative:Weighting the state features and learning the weights through metric learning techniques such that neighboring states represent similar game situation.
This method is useful in game learning tasks, where the state space is very large , but discrete as is proved by the authors of this paper:-

I personally have used Deep Q-Learning to approximate the Q-value function.
See 'report.doc' to know about Q-value function.
