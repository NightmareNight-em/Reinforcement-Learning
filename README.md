# reinforcement-learning
Atari game using Deep Q-learning along with epsilon-greedy algorithm
Have a look at 'report.doc' document to have a mathematical and theoritical look at Reinforcement Learning,specifically the Deep Q-Learning.
Also,you'll get to see two atari game(FrozenLake and Pacman)where agent learns the environment by itself.
I have made use of openAI gym toolkit to get an artificial environment for my agent to train.
